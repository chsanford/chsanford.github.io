		<p style="color:orange">This is an important milestone for Barbara and Clayton. Why you may ask? For this first time, Barbara and Clayton are both have ugly numbers for their ages!! 23 and 19? Gross! Here are all of the previous pairings of numbers to show that there has never been as gross of a pairing as these:</p>

			[Actually, nevermind, that's patently false. It was pretty rough when Barbara was 13 and Clayton was 17 too. But I'd argue that 19/23 is <b>far</b> worse than 13/17.]
		</p>
		<p style="color:green">
			Anyways, in this year of meaningless age numbers, we're here to celebrate our milestones as sibs. Here are a few things we can celebrate:
		</p>
		<ul style="list-style-type: square">
			<li style="color:orange">
				Barbara graduated from high school! We are now free of Soquel High! Yay!
				<img src="img/grad.jpg">
				Also, Clayton uses this photo and crops Barbara out frequently when he needs a decent photo of himself
			</li>
			<li style="color:purple">
				They are now both students going to very extra schools.
				<img src="img/waffle.jpg">
			</li>
			<li style="color:orange">
				Clayton and Barbara are much closer, not just as siblings but also as friends! Because this is public and online and literally anyone could see this, Clayton will not confirm that he drunk-called Barbara. But he won't confirm that he didn't either.
			</li>
			<li style="color:orange">
				<i>They are pro memers and share quality content with one another. Here's a sampling of top tier content.</i><br>
				<img src="img/barb.jpeg">
				<img src="img/wa.png">
				<img src="img/zelda.png">
			</li>
			<li style="color:purple">
				They signed a tentative peace treaty in their YIMBY vs cottage war by focusing on their common enemy: <a href="mcmansionhell.com">McMansions</a>.
			</li>
			<li style="color:green">
				They heard each other say bad words for the first time.
			</li>
			<li style="color:purple">
				Barbara is a beautiful and lovely young lady: 
				<img src="img/draw.jpg">
			</li>
			<li style="color:purple">
				Their chat is #iconic:<br>

			Alright, serious message time. I'll even change to a more serious font:
		</p>
		<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">
			This has been a really big transitional year for both of us -- new coasts, new places to live, new schools. There's been a lot to get used to this year, and I'm happy that we've been able to share so much of our learning experiences with one another. I'm proud of the person you've become, and I'm excited for the all of the adventures we have coming up. I love you so much, Barbara, and I wish you a wonderful 19th birthday.
		</p>
		<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">
			Love, Clayton

      <h4>10 December 2016</h4>

        I'm clearly not an artist. It's pretty easy to tell with the odd mishapen
        fern-thing on a piece of paper that has math problems on the reverse side.
        It's also evident with all the scribbles in the grass and red wave in the left
        piece. No, that's not artistic expression; that's me not knowing what I'm doing.

        A few years ago, making something like that would have aggrevated me. 
        I was in the mindset that I needed to be good at everything I did. 
        I wanted to do art because I thought there was some deficiency I had to correct.
        I was too left-brain, too mathy, too analytical.
        I needed to balance myself by being more creative, and visual art seemed to be a good way to do that.
        But then, the reason for making art was to have some other skill to show off,
        so I could say, "Hey look, I'm actually a well-rounded person."

        To put things in algorithmic terms, it's like I thought of life as an objective function.
        To be a great person, one needs to maximize it by checking all sorts of boxes in different areas.
        One of the surest ways for me to up my objective value was to increase the creativity variables, which would require practice, improvement, and results.
        Predictably, I overanalyzed everything I made, all the wrong strokes, all the many imperfections.
        I often grew angry with it, unreasonably so for a silly sketch.
        The natural response was to give up because I made no progress.

        I spent Thanksgiving with my cousins in Maine. (Plane tickets to California are expensive.)
        Soon after arriving, two of my cousins broke out an art kit with watercolor, oil pastels, and colored pencils and starting making free-flowing colorful sketches.
        I noticed that they weren't focused on their final creations.
        The quality of their final pieces didn't correlate with their happiness because that wasn't the point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspired, I went on Amazon on bought the same kit.
        I tried it out a few days later, while I was on a never-ending Skype call where I was listening much more than talking.
        It was a nice distraction. I liked keeping my hands busy. (Anyone who knows me can tell that I cannot sit still.)
        The shaky fern was most satisfying piece; painting the offshoots of each leaf helped me get into a comfortable sort of repetition.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm trying to use art to add more balance to my life once again, but it's from a different angle.
        I want it to reduce stress, to be something available after a long day of coding.

        I made a half-finished website in July. It's still half-finished, but I decided to incorporate a blog because I always fear what people will think of me.
        I want to use this to write and put thoughts out in the open.
        I do this understanding that I am not a good writer, but that I want to practice making my voice heard. That's how I get better.
